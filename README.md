# Golf-Score-App
An app written in Python with the Kivy module for EDD spring 2020. The goal is for golfers to have an easy way to track their progress by giving them as many data points as possible. This is done by giving information such as best score, average score, par rate, green rate, and more for each hole and for the entire course. Along with personal data, it keeps teh same sdata points for all of the golfers combined to give users a feel for how they stack up to other golfers on the same course. I've also added a leaderboard with several records that anybody can set, this adds a bit of competition for those who want to partake.
